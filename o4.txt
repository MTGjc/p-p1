is untraceable
is missing
 through the Gypsy's eyes
in his shoes
on the journey
angry
Un eclair... puis la nuit!
Fleeting Gypsy
around these parts
from his hand
"""God will bless you Tony!"""
"""she is the one of kind"""
"""wish you good luck"""
"""there was no one here by that name"""
 the gypsy knows all
she'll help you through
"Your life will be better,guaranteed!"
carefree
purposeful
for the moment
for the journey's end
on the go
from place to place
free-spirited
carefree
 not the gypsy
 as normal
""where's the Gypsy?""
shocked
You also know the Gypsy?
The Gypsy. Ou est elle?
I think they might be at the Notre Dame de Paris. You should go check it out. Good Boy!
"Let me know if you see her, ok? Boy."
Be very careful. They are the sinners.
 full of gypsies
Hi! Sorry, umm I've been observing both of you discussing. What are you looking for? What are you discussing? Mr. DHL man?
The Gypsy, the bar the Gypsy?
It's just around the corner, it's a bar, not a person
It's a bar, not a person
Hey hey! What are you doing here. What's happening? This isn't a bar, this is a crystal shop. It changed last week. I took it over from my grandma and we sell Gypsy stuffs, people all seem to like it.
Crystal is spiritual , Jesus!
oh I'm sorry I brought them here because this delivery man said he has this parcel delivered to the Gypsy, and it doesn't have any address, so I thought it might be delivered to the bar the Gypsy. But I didn't realize that this is no longer..
oh no no no no no common mistakes here sir. I do remember that my grandma is a friend of someone, she goes by the Gypsy.
what's my grandma's name?
Everyone knows her name.
her name is Mol
So your grandma is the Gypsy
Her friend is the Gypsy, But I haven't seen her around here for a while.
Possibly. That's her nickname.
Who's that person outside? That person right there ?
You are the Gypsy?
Take your glasses off. I can't recognize
Oh! You know grandma Mol
