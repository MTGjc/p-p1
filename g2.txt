staying in
eating 
enjoy
knows
I don't live at 
I don't expect
can find 
 I will give you
Keep
wearing my hat
liked to play thicks on others
mess with
started cursing
 just sitting here
experience the nature
looked back on me
tried to share me
i ran away
i know
u could recognize her right away
u would tell
