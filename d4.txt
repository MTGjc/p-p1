impossible
so special
You're always on the move
This letter needs to be delivered to “theGypsy"
You should at least leave an address or number!
it was for the Gypsy woman
And that's why I can never catch you
I'll find you
It won't be easy
But it's the only way
How am I going to deliver the letter to a dead man then?
Now I can pass the letter to you, could you help me giving it to the Gypsy please?
in return  for the cat
decided
look for the cat first
immobile
slowly
stained
unclear
drunk
dead
Shit I have to get up and deliver packages
but I want to be an areophane engineer.
" It was a hard night of partying last night,"
the thing started getting weird:
I’m looking for the Gypsy.
It's a bar?
That's perfect, I love partying, let's go to the bar!
But sir, are you the Gypsy?
Do you have an ID on you, proving that you are the Gypsy?
So maybe the package is supposed to delivered to your grandma's friend. The Gypsy
Is that your grandma's friend?
ok I'm sweating very much right now, from this aspirin this morning. I'm going to put this on the ground between both of you and you can sort it out yourselves. I don't care anymore.
