You're always on the move

You should at least leave an address or number!
I'll find you

And that's why I can never catch you

Iâ€™m looking for the Gypsy.
look for the cat first
I am the gypsy
you will be here
we can meet

So numbers and address is not necessary.
Dont be angry my friend
Keep my hat, it will warm you.
I am A gypsy.
